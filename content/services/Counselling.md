The Fresh Start Recovery counselling team consists of four professionally trained staff (male and female) providing a range of services and approaches geared toward individuals, couples and families.

Our service helps people address their substance use and the impact it may be having on their lives. Alcohol and other drug use can adversely affect relationships, health, work, mental state and other areas of life. Counselling aims to help people with addictions to focus on underlying issues that have previously contributed to continued drug use and subsequent relapse. Issues underpinning or accompanying drug use might include trauma, depression, grief and loss, behavioural problems or anxiety.

Using a range of tools for discussion, all our counsellors adopt an integrated person-centred and collaborative approach, ensuring that clients determine their own treatment goals and are actively involved in developing their own recovery plans.
