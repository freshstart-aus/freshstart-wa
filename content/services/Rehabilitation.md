## Northam Recovery Program

Fresh Start has two residential rehabilitation properties for men located in Northam. Our program is a Modified Therapeutic Community model in which the community itself is the principal means for promoting personal change through self-help and mutual support. Residents begin their journey at Northam Recovery Centre, graduating to The Hill when ready.

### Northam Recovery Centre

This three story building located in Northam has sleeping quarters for up to 40 men, common areas, garden area, chicken shed and vegetable patch. Residents will also be able to use the gym and other sporting and educational facilities in Northam.
