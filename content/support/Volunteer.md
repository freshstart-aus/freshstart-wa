Fresh Start Recovery Programme is committed to excellent service to both our clients and the wider community. Delivering this service would not be possible without the help of our committed volunteers.

Among the valuable services our volunteers provide are:

* helping care for patients during their detox period
* helping transport patients
* assisting with administrative duties in the office
* preparing food for patients on treatment days
* taking part in busy bees to freshen up and maintain the residential housing.

Please contact our Manager of Volunteer Services, Judy, on 08 9381 1333 if you would like to make a difference in the community and help give people a fresh start in life. Download our [Volunteer Your Time](/docs/volunteer.pdf) brochure for more information.
