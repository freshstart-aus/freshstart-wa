Fresh Start would be delighted to visit your community group or church or come to a gathering in your home. We have a number of presentations that are suitable for different settings, such as:

* “Help us to help families with addictions” (a fundraising talk by our CEO)
* “Helping families avoid addictions” (presented by one of our senior staff)
* “Why do children from good families still get addicted?” (presented by one of our doctors).

Our CEO and chaplains are also available to preach or present a “spot” during a Sunday service. Please [contact us](/contact/contact) for more information or to make a booking.
