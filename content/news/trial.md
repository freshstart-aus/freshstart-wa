The University of Western Australia is part-way through a clinical trial, testing a new Smoking Cessation Spray invented by Dr George O’Neil. A preliminary study involving ten Fresh Start clients indicated that the spray significantly reduces anxiety and the urge to smoke. These initial findings were promising enough to initiate a larger, randomized placebo-controlled trial.

Early participants in the trial have commented that “Using the active spray I felt much more chilled and didn’t even feel like having a cigarette” and “Since participating in the trial I feel way more confident about quitting smoking.”

The nasal Smoking Cessation Spray provides anti-craving effects and may reduce anxiety. Cravings and anxiety are prominent cigarette withdrawal symptoms, typically occurring within an hour of the last cigarette. The Smoking Cessation Spray can be used whenever these symptoms occur, providing relief within one to two minutes.
