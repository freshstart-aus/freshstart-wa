The committed and brave life of Chris O'Donoghue illustrates the long, hard road a drug addict takes to drive out their cravings. In 2007 Chris arrived on Fresh Start’s doorstep in the depths of addiction, only recovering after three years of treatment. He went on to volunteer at Fresh Start and eventually became a paid employee. In 2010 he returned to his family and friends in Queensland. As Chris recounts, 

> Complacency has always been a stumbling block for me...

He relapsed into heroin, Suboxone and benzodiazepine use. Later that year Chris returned to Fresh Start, responding positively to the naltrexone treatment.

"Naltrexone helped me." Chris said, "But I never really addressed the reasons I was using, and I never committed to a program of recovery to complement the implant treatment.”

Recovering a second time, Chris returned to Queensland. Things went from good to bad to worse as he once more lapsed into Suboxone use. Then in April 2011 he was arrested for robbing a pharmacy to obtain more Suboxone. Chris was sentenced to five years in prison.

"It was a painful time. But, during this time I stayed close to God and he gave me a second chance, unlike a few of my mates. They say people on drugs either end up dead or in prison. I guess I got the prison option, my mates weren’t so lucky....”

A reformed Chris was released from prison 14 months into his sentence. He moved to Bundaberg, joined a church group, made good friends and found love. Chris became a community volunteer and worked non-stop during the devastating Bundaberg floods of 2013.

In 2014 Chris completed a degree in Criminology and Criminal Justice. He was invited to enrol in the Griffith University criminology honours college a year later where he graduated with honours. But two decades of drug abuse, re-lapses and a term in prison took a personal toll as his partner left him. Again Chris fought back, entering the Salvation Army program in May 2016. He recently completed the transition phase. Chris has become involved with the local Southport Salvation Army Temple Corps, and is a volunteer bus driver taking people to detox to start their recovery program. As a peer support worker, Chris offers his experience, strength and hope to those battling addiction. He’s also established a relationship with the Australian Anti Ice Campaign (AAIC) raising funds to educate teenagers about Ice addiction.

Chris is actively involved in several 12 step programs around the Gold Coast.

"What I hear and see there gives me hope for the future, and it also reminds me not to become complacent again."

Chris now lives on the Gold Coast and has a good relationship with his family and friends.
