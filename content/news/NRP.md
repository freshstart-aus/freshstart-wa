At Fresh Start we recommend that our clients participate in a Rehabilitation Program after treatment. It removes those struggling with addiction from their old ways of life and places them into a facility that offers 24/7 care. In-house recovery programs help to eliminate stress by removing the individual from temptation and reducing the chance of relapse.

Northam Recovery Program (NRP) offers a comprehensive residential program focused on menâ€™s recovery. Residents will begin their journey at Northam Recovery Centre until they are able to graduate to The Hill a farm based centre 8kms from Northam. Both have the same core program with differing activities and responsibilities.

This year alone we have had *65 new* admissions to Northam.

When a potential client is interested in Northam they will have the opportunity to meet our Recovery Co-ordinator and discuss any queries or questions they may have. Patients will receive an information brochure and some basic information about the program. A weekly outreach program is also held at the clinic for potential residents and former clients wanting to return to Northam.

Following the naltrexone implant treatment patients will need to complete the following steps before progressing to Northam:

* Northam Admission Application
* Medical Assessment with our Doctors
* Suitability Assessment with our Counsellors
* Must have a Mental Health Care Plan
* Urine drug screen test
* Any court paperwork must be provided
* NRP Rent Paperwork (Centrelink set up)
* First 2 weeks rent paid upfront.

Once all stages of the process are completed clients are able to make the transition to Northam, where the next part of their recovery journey begins.
