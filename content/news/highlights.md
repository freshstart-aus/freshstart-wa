The past 12 months has been a very exciting time for our Hepatitis Clinic and we have successfully treated over 100 patients for Hepatitis C with the newly released, directly acting anti-viral tablets that are both well tolerated and highly effective. Dr Wendy Lawrence and specialist Hepatitis nurse Julie Stove work closely to provide the clinical support needed by the 55 people currently in treatment.
