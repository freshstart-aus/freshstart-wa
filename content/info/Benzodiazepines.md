Benzodiazepines include diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), midazolam, oxazepam (Serepax), temazepam and nitrazepam (Mogadon). Benzodiazepines are prescription drugs and many people who have become addicted to them did so after a doctor prescribed them.

Benzodiazepines reduce anxiety. However, people who use them for some time often find they need higher and higher doses to achieve the same effect. This is because prolonged use makes the receptors in the brain that detect them less sensitive. Someone who becomes addicted to benzodiazepines can feel shaky and anxious almost all the time because their bodyâ€™s own natural benzodiazepine molecules are no longer effective in calming them down. That makes benzodiazepines hard to come off.

A lot of overdose deaths are caused by using a combination of drugs such as heroin and benzodiazepines.
